    * client A is listening on 8081 and client B is listening on 8082

* start customer , it was named hystrix-demo-customer

* view http://localhost:8083

    * keep refresh the page , you can find client A and client B is offering their server .
    
    * now , cancel client B's server (just simple kill it )
    
    * keep refresh the page , you can find hystrix can find that client B have error until eureka remove B from the server's list .
     
    * now , let's open client B again .
     
    * keep refresh the page , because client a and client b's Thread will sleep some time in random .
